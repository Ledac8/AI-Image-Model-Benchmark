# AI Image Model Benchmark Framework

A comprehensive framework for systematically evaluating and comparing AI image generation models through prompt engineering and qualitative analysis.

## 🎯 Purpose

As a Product Marketer in the AI image generation space, understanding model capabilities and limitations is crucial. This project provides:

- **Standardized testing methodology** for AI image models
- **Qualitative comparison framework** across multiple vendors
- **Strategic insights** for product positioning and messaging
- **Data-driven recommendations** for feature development

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install required packages
2. Running the Analysis
Open analysis.ipynb in Jupyter

Generate images using prompts from prompt_suites/

Save images to appropriate folders in generated_images/

Use the comparison functions to analyze results

Document insights in the notebook and strategic report

🧪 Testing Methodology
Prompt Categories
Photorealism: Testing realistic rendering capabilities

Spatial Reasoning: Assessing understanding of spatial relationships

Text Rendering: Evaluating text generation and integration

Artistic Styles: Testing interpretation of different art styles

Complex Composition: Assessing handling of detailed, multi-element scenes

Abstract Concepts: Evaluating interpretation of non-literal ideas

Evaluation Criteria
Prompt adherence and understanding

Aesthetic quality and style consistency

Technical execution and artifact control

Creativity and interpretation

Edge case handling

📊 Expected Outcomes
Competitive analysis of major AI image models

Identification of market gaps and opportunities

Data-driven positioning strategy

Content marketing insights

Product roadmap recommendations

4. **Commit your changes**

## Phase 5: Generate Test Images and Populate Your Repository

### Step 7: Create the Image Folders
1. **Click "Add file"** → **"Create new file"**
2. **Type:** `generated_images/dalle-3/.gitkeep`
3. **Leave the content empty** and commit with message "Add DALL-E 3 folder"
4. **Repeat** for:
   - `generated_images/midjourney/.gitkeep`
   - `generated_images/stable-diffusion-xl/.gitkeep`

**Why .gitkeep?** Git doesn't track empty folders. This trick tells Git to keep the folder structure.

### Step 8: Generate Actual Test Images
Now for the hands-on part! You'll use free tools to generate images:

**For DALL-E 3:**
1. Go to chat.openai.com (free account works)
2. Type: "Generate an image of: [paste prompt from your CSV]"
3. Download the image
4. Save it to your computer with a descriptive name like `photorealism_dog.jpg`

**For Midjourney:**
1. If you have access, use Midjourney
2. Or use free alternatives like Bing Image Creator (which uses DALL-E 3) and note it's a different model

**For Stable Diffusion:**
1. Go to clipdrop.co (free tier available)
2. Use their "Text to Image" feature
3. Download the results

### Step 9: Upload Your Test Images
1. **Navigate to** `generated_images/dalle-3/` in your repository
2. **Click "Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
3. **Drag and drop** your DALL-E 3 test images
4. **Add a commit message:** "Add DALL-E 3 test images"
5. **Click "Commit changes"**
6. **Repeat** for the other model folders

## Phase 6: Final Touches

### Step 10: Add Topics to Your Repository
1. **Go to your repository's main page**
2. **Click on the gear icon** (⚙️) next to "About" on the right side
3. **Add these topics** (makes your repo discoverable):
   - `ai-image-generation`
   - `prompt-engineering`
   - `model-evaluation`
   - `product-marketing`
   - `competitive-analysis`
4. **Click "Save changes"**

## You're Done! 🎉

### What You've Accomplished:
- ✅ **Professional GitHub repository** with proper structure
- ✅ **Systematic testing framework** for AI image models
- ✅ **Technical documentation** showing your methodology
- ✅ **Strategic analysis template** for business insights
- ✅ **Portfolio piece** that demonstrates technical PMM skills

### Next Steps:
1. **Actually run the tests** with different prompts over time
2. **Update your analysis notebook** with real findings
3. **Fill out the strategic recommendations** with your insights
4. **Share your GitHub profile** in your resume and interviews

Your GitHub now shows recruiters that you're a PMM who understands the technical landscape and can create systematic frameworks for market analysis!
